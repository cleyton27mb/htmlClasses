<hr/>
<!-- This tag to put any content in the center of the page or any table cell -->
<center><p> Here is my first paragraph of text.</p></center>

<!-- Any text between the opening <pre> tag and the closing </pre> tag will preserve the

document. In these cases, you can use the preformatted tag</p>
<pre></pre>

<p>An example of this technique appears in the movie "12&nbsp;Angry&nbsp;Men."</p>
